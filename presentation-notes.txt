Challenges:
===========

	- Alien model has a single bone making programmatic animation difficult

		+ Simple sine wave movement (the model waddle)

	- Asteroid explosion and scattering

		+ TBD

	- Asteroid bombardment - Getting them to enter world at dodgable pace and still look believable

		+ Scaling and trial and error

	- Manual merge hell

		+ Better once everyone started drinking the Git Kool-aid

Frank:

	- Asteroid bombardment

		+ Dynamic starting position in the sky

		+ Speed up as they get closer to the terrain

	- Implemented camera shaking when asteroids collide near-by

	- Mouse support for camera

	- Implemented HUD (health bar and radar)

	- Intro cut scene video

Anthony:

	- Space ship level

		+ Implemented space ship specific camera functionality
